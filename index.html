                I'm an ambitious, lifelong learning, analytical & technical professional seeking opportunities to be challenged within the SDLC. I'm excited and able to learn new technologies, both proprietary and common/standard. Commitment to excellence in internal and external customer satisfaction and problem solving is held to a high standard.
                In the past 10 years, I've experienced all roles within the SDLC and continue to gain greater knowledge of each. I have a history of providing interdepartmental coordination to maximize business functionality and efficiency on both Product and Tech sides in Analyst roles. I'm currently enrolled in part-time Full Stack Bootcamp at Ohio State University, pending graduation October 2023. I have done Quality Assurance, both manual and automated, for web-based software, websites, mobile, API, and Conversational AI/NLU. I also have experience with release management, production monitoring, and triage.
                I pride myself on inclusivity, openness, and flexibility through social awareness of the team, providing compassion and space to chat, along with being able to assist others with change.
